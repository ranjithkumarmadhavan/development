1. install putty and putty key gen.
2. convert pem file to ppk using putty key gen.
3. open putty and ec2-user@{public-ip} in host and goto ssh -> auth, click brower button and upload the ppk file.
4. then click on session again and load the file.then click open.
5. windows machine must have openssh-client and openssh-server feature installed.

or

1. windows machine must have openssh-client and openssh-server feature installed.
2. download pem file from ec2.
3. open powershell in pem downloaded location and execute following commands.

$path = ".\ec2KeyPair.pem"
# Reset to remove explicit permissions
icacls.exe $path /reset
# Give current user explicit read-permission
icacls.exe $path /GRANT:R "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
# Disable inheritance and remove inherited permissions
icacls.exe $path /inheritance:r

after logging in commands
1. sudo su
2. yum update -y 
3. yum install httpd -y
4. systemctl start httpd
5. systemctl enable httpd
6. systemctl status httpd

now Active must display

Adding html page
1. cd /var/www/html
2. nano index.html (nano is default text editor in linux)
3. chown ec2-user . (for allowing to copy files into linux)

scp -i ./ec2KeyPair.pem -r ./Login/* ec2-user@54.211.55.161:/var/www/html


In AWS management console:
Creat security group
Creat keypair (.pem)
Launch EC2 instance. Attach keypair and security group
convert keypair .pem to .ppk
SSH into your ec2 instance and run the following commands
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
chown ec2-user .

On your computer:
Copy the keypair (.pem format) to the folder where the files(that you want to transfer) are present.
Open the command prompt
Change directory to the location of your folder
Run the following command for copying the file to copy only the contents of local_dir and not the directory local_dir itself:
scp -i ./key-pair.pem ./path/to/files/ username@public-ip:/pathwhere/you/need/to/copy

For example:
scp -i ./Ec2KeyPair.pem -r ./Velocity/* ec2-user@107.21.140.196:/var/www/html


To copy a single file from local directory:
scp -i ./Ec2KeyPair.pem ./scp.txt ec2-user@107.21.140.196:/var/www/html

Copy directory local_dir with all its sub-directories:
scp -i ./Ec2KeyPair.pem -r ./Velocity ec2-user@107.21.140.196:/var/www/html

Copy only the contents of local_dir and not the directory local_dir itself:
scp -i ./Ec2KeyPair.pem -r ./Velocity/* ec2-user@107.21.140.196:/var/www/html
